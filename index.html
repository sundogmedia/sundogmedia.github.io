		 <div id="about-tab" class="tab"><p>I’ve practiced law in Alaska for over 16 years. I’ve worked in law firms and as in-house counsel for large corporations. I started Vellum LLC in 2011. Why start a new company? Because there’s a much better way to provide legal services to Alaska’s small businesses and nobody else was doing it. So I redesigned the law firm from the ground up so that small businesses like yours can have a legal department like the big guys.</p></div>

	<div class="item"><img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/mccarthy.jpg" alt="McCarthy Ventures, LLC" width="245" height="255" /><p>McCarthy Ventures LLC has been using Vellum as our Legal Department for several years now.  We own and operate several hospitality businesses including 2 liquor licenses and 34 staff.  The need for expert legal advice is critical for our operations. Having a legal department means having one source for all our legal questions and advice. We can count on contracts, questions, advice and resolutions - basically everything short of litigation - to be handled for one flat rate.</p><h2>Neil Darish   |   <a href="http://www.mccarthylodge.com/" target="_blank">McCarthy Lodge</a></h2></div>
	<div class="item"><img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/billy.jpg" alt="Billy St. Pierre" width="245" height="255" /><p>"I've really enjoyed using Vellum LLC's Inside-Out Legal Services. It eliminates the need to manage one more thing during my busy day- tracking the amount of time my lawyer spends on projects- and there aren't any surprise bills at the end of the month. Yet I'm still getting competent and thorough insight and explanations month by month on varying small business concerns like payroll, employee management, and optimal company structure. It's been a fantastic experience so far!"</p><h2>Billy St. Pierre   |   <a href="http://pitapitusa.com/" target="_blank">Pita Pit</a></h2></div>

I am thankful to have Vellum, LLC in Sundog Media’s corner and for the thoughtful counsel I have received over the years. As an Alaskan company I feel I can count on Vellum’s knowledge and legal expertise to guide us as we strive to build a company that is above reproach. </p><h2>Joe Law   |   <a href="http://sundogmedia.com" target="_blank">Sundog Media</a></h2></div>
