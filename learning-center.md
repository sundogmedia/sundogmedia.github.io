Most likely you’re either start­ing a busi­ness or you’re run­ning a small busi­ness right now. You might even be think­ing about sell­ing your busi­ness, but no mat­ter where you’re at in the life of a busi­ness, you have legal risks.

Man­ag­ing these risks is hard work and easy to ignore. Most small busi­ness own­ers ignore them until some­thing goes really bad, then they call a lawyer and find out how costly that approach can be.

What can you do to man­age these risks? There are self-help books; but it takes a lot of time to read all the books required to under­stand and man­age these risks.

You can use online ser­vices. But these ser­vices lack the help of a local attor­ney and nor­mally pro­vide one-size-fits-all solutions.

You can call an attor­ney from a tra­di­tional law firm. This is expen­sive and tra­di­tional law firms aren’t equipped with the tools needed to man­age legal risks. They’re mostly good at react­ing to legal prob­lems rather than pre­vent­ing them.

The solu­tion: Inside-out Legal Services:

<ul><li>is a low-cost way to man­age legal risks the same way large cor­po­ra­tions do</li>
<li>is about learn­ing just enough law to be aware of what can harm a small business</li>
<li>is about tak­ing pre­ven­tive measures</li>
<li> can be your legal department</li></ul>
