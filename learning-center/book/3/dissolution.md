Yes, it’s sad to say, but there may a come a time when Mr. LLC dies. The mem­bers nor­mally make this deci­sion; but some­times the state or a judge will force its death. The mem­bers nor­mally appoint some­one to wrap up Mr. LLC’s busi­ness, pay its debts, dis­trib­ute the prof­its and assets, and file the doc­u­ments nec­es­sary with the state to offi­cially notify it of Mr. LLC’s death. You also can do some things to cut off cred­i­tor claims after a cer­tain period of time passes from Mr. LLC’s death.
