It’s a good idea to include a pro­vi­sion in your oper­at­ing agree­ment requir­ing you to keep the fol­low­ing records related to the orga­ni­za­tion and oper­a­tions of Mr. LLC:

<ul><li>Full name and last known mail­ing address of every man­ager and member.</li>
<li>Arti­cles of orga­ni­za­tion (amend­ments and restated articles).</li>
<li>The LLC’s tax returns and finan­cial state­ments for the last three years. If the LLC didn’t file tax returns, then copies of the infor­ma­tion given to mem­bers to file their tax returns.</li>
<li>Oper­at­ing agree­ments and amend­ments, includ­ing for­mer oper­at­ing agreements.</li>
<li>Min­utes of meet­ings and evi­dence of voting.</li></ul>

All mem­bers may inspect and copy records and books for any rea­son. They just need to ask the man­ager for a copy of the record. The man­ager needs to promptly pro­vide mem­ber with requested records or give mem­ber access to the record. But each mem­ber is still under a duty of con­fi­den­tial­ity regard­ing the record. The oper­at­ing agree­ment may mod­ify these rights.
