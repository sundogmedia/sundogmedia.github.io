This seems like a sim­ple mat­ter, but money can get com­pli­cated. Let’s break down each piece.

<h2>Ten­ant Improvements</h2> 

If your land­lord gives you a ten­ant improve­ment allowance, you should decide how and when it will be paid, what it includes (includ­ing soft costs such as archi­tec­tural fees, legal fees, build­ing per­mit fees, sig­nage costs, mov­ing costs, etc.), and what hap­pens if the land­lord fails to pay you back for reim­bursable costs. You may want to require the land­lord to place the money in escrow.

<h2>Rent Cal­cu­la­tion</h2> 

Rent can be as easy as pay­ing a flat amount monthly for every­thing you need to oper­ate in your space. It can also include com­pli­cated for­mu­las bro­ken into parts. Here are some items that might be included in your rent:

<ul><li><strong>Prop­erty Taxes:</strong> address spe­cial assess­ments in this item.</li>
<li><strong>Insur­ance:</strong> find out about pre­mi­ums and what hap­pens when prices increase.</li>
<li><strong>Com­mon Areas Main­te­nance:</strong> this is often shared between the land­lord and other ten­ants; but the wrong for­mula can be costly.</li>
<li><strong>Util­i­ties:</strong> make a detailed list of who pays what. If the land­lord pays util­i­ties, make sure that it’s not a profit cen­ter for them.</li>
<li><strong>Cap­i­tal Expenses:</strong> do you have to pay for any cap­i­tal expenses? If so, how and when?</li></ul>

If any part of your rent is based on a for­mula, then get the right to audit and review the books and records and to rec­on­cile statements.

<h2>Rent Abate­ment</h2> 

The abil­ity to abate your rent based on defaults is one of the most pow­er­ful ways to force your land­lord to com­ply with the lease. Oth­er­wise you have to take them to court and get an order, which can take a long time.
