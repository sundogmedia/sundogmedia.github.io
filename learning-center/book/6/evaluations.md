It’s not clear whether eval­u­a­tions improve per­for­mance or safety. But it does pro­vide you with a good sys­tem to doc­u­ment per­for­mance. If you con­duct eval­u­a­tions, tell it like it is. If something’s not good, give exam­ples, set goals, and fol­low up. Warn the employee that fail­ure to improve might lead to dis­ci­pli­nary action. These need to be sys­tem­atic and ongo­ing. Don’t be exces­sively lenient, don’t avoid the ends of the rat­ing scale, and base it on the whole eval­u­a­tion period.
