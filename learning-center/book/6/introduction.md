You need employees to get things done. But when you hire employees, you also hire risk. Here are 10 gen­eral rules to min­i­mize employee risks:

<ul><li>Set clear expec­ta­tions between you and your employ­ees in a con­cise and well-written employee handbook.</li>
<li>Base all employ­ment deci­sions on rel­e­vant and legal factors.</li>
<li>Encour­age cowork­ers to live the golden rule.</li>
<li>Keep the job-site safe.</li>
<li>Doc­u­ment and date things as they hap­pen and get sig­na­tures. But don’t go crazy with documentation.</li>
<li>Don’t be a jerk. Hos­tile, intim­i­dat­ing, and offen­sive behav­ior has no place in the workplace.</li>
<li>Look into employ­ment prac­tices lia­bil­ity insurance.</li>
<li>Be con­sis­tent in train­ing, reviews, and enforcement.</li>
<li>Read lots of busi­ness books.</li>
<li>Respect your employ­ees’ rea­son­able expec­ta­tions of pri­vacy. If you fol­low these rules, you will go a long way toward avoid­ing costly and time-consuming legal disputes.</li></ul>
