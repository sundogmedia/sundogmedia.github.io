The clos­ing is when all the par­ties who have the author­ity to sign the doc­u­ments meet and final­ize the trans­ac­tion. This can take place at the busi­ness, an attorney’s office, or some­where where it’s easy to make copies and last minute changes. When all the doc­u­ments are signed, the buyer walks away with a busi­ness and the seller walks away with cash or rights to receive cash.
