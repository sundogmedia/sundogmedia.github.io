Con­grat­u­la­tions! You’re start­ing a busi­ness in Alaska. Or maybe you’re an exist­ing busi­ness and are grow­ing. Or maybe you’re one of those busi­nesses that started up with­out giv­ing any thought to your busi­ness structure.

What­ever the case, your struc­ture either pro­tects you or exposes you to lia­bil­ity. It can affect how much you pay in taxes. It affects how you work with other busi­ness own­ers. Some­times it can make or break you.

How should you struc­ture your busi­ness? Let’s look at the num­ber of busi­nesses formed in Alaska in 2010 to see what oth­ers are doing. Here they are:
<ul><li>9,000 sole pro­pri­etor­ship or partnerships</li>
<li>624 cor­po­ra­tions</li>
<li>2799 lim­ited lia­bil­ity companies</li>
<li>10 lim­ited lia­bil­ity partnerships</li>
<li>115 lim­ited partnerships</li>
<li>25 pro­fes­sional corporations</li></ul>
